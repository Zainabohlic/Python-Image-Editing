## Description

This project is a Python script that processes images located in a folder and applies two image editing operations:

1. **Smooth Effect**: It applies a smooth filter to the image, giving it a smoother and less sharp appearance.

2. **Contrast Adjustment**: It adjusts the contrast of the image, making it brighter or darker based on the provided factor.

## Prerequisites

Before using the script, you need to have the following:

- Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- Pillow: You will need to install the Pillow library, which is used for image processing.

You can install Pillow using pip:
```bash
pip install Pillow
